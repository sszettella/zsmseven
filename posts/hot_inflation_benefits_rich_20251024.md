# Why the Financial System Loves Hot Inflation

Inflation is often discussed in terms of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the official measure used by governments to track price changes in a basket of goods and services. However, critics argue that CPI understates "true" inflation—the erosion of purchasing power felt by everyday people in areas like housing, healthcare, and education. For instance, alternative measures suggest inflation has outpaced CPI by significant margins since the early 2000s.

This discrepancy isn't accidental; the modern financial system appears structured to encourage "hot" inflation levels that benefit those at its core: central banks, large financial institutions, and wealthy asset holders. Below, we examine three key mechanisms driving this dynamic.

## The Cantillon Effect: Proximity to the Money Printer

Named after 18th century economist Richard Cantillon, this effect describes how new money enters the economy unevenly. When central banks create money through quantitative easing or low-interest lending, it first reaches banks, corporations, and governments, those closest to the source. These entities buy assets like stocks and real estate before prices adjust, inflating their values and generating gains for early recipients.

In contrast, wage earners and dollar savers receive the money later, after prices have risen, effectively paying more for the same goods. Modern examples abound: During the 2020-2022 stimulus period, asset prices surged while consumer costs followed suit, widening wealth gaps.

Recent discussions on X highlight this, with users noting how inflation funnels gains to the top 0.1% via proximity to policy levers.

## Capital Gains Taxes: Taxing Phantom Profits

Inflation boosts nominal asset values.  For example, your home or stock portfolio might "gain" 10% in a year, but if inflation is 7%, the real gain is just 3%. Yet, capital gains taxes apply to the full nominal amount, creating a windfall for governments. This "inflation tax" on unrealized gains has been criticized as unfair, as it taxes money that doesn't represent true economic growth. [See how inflation inflates capital gains taxes](https://www.cato.org/blog/inflation-can-increase-capital-gains-tax-rate-infinity).

For the system’s insiders, this is a double win: They realize these gains (paying taxes, yes, but on inflated sums that fund further investments), while the revenue bolsters public coffers without raising rates on ordinary income. Proposals to index gains for inflation have stalled, preserving this revenue stream. On X, economists point out this as a core inefficiency, where paper profits become taxable illusions.

## Cheap Credit: Negative Real Rates as a Wealth Siphon

Central banks chronically set nominal interest rates below true inflation rates, resulting in negative real rates. Borrowers, typically corporations and high-net-worth individuals, pay back loans with devalued dollars, effectively transferring wealth from savers (who earn near-zero returns) to debtors.

This dynamic has accelerated inequality: Savers in cash or bonds lose purchasing power, while asset owners leverage cheap debt to buy appreciating properties or equities. Studies show inflation's wealth transfer effect reduced asset values for low-wealth households by up to 20% in recent years. [Explore negative real rates' impact](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/2022/aug/impact-inflation-wealth-transfer-effect). X threads echo this, describing it as a "transfer from the working class to the capital class."

## A Bottom-Up Wealth Transfer in Action

Collectively, these incentives create a subtle but powerful redistribution: Wages lag far behind asset price growth, eroding savings' value while scarce resources like housing become pricier. Since 1970, U.S. home prices have risen over 1,700% nominally—far outpacing wage growth of about 900%. Adjusted for CPI inflation (let alone "true" inflation in assets), real wages have grown just ~15%, while homes are nearly 6x more expensive in real terms—revealing a systemic tilt toward owners. Those with little or no assets bear the brunt as dollars lose value against real estate, stocks, and commodities.

This isn't a conspiracy, but rather an emergent outcome of fiat money systems prioritizing growth and stability. Understanding it empowers better decisions, like diversifying beyond cash.
