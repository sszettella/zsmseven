### Portfolio Opportunity Analysis
This analysis evaluates each ticker in the ZSM Seven portfolio for buying opportunities based on current price relative to the 50-day moving average (MA50) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Scores range from -10 to 10, where 10 indicates an excellent buying opportunity (e.g., oversold conditions or price dips), 0 is neutral (neutral RSI and price close to MA50), and negative scores suggest poorer timing (e.g., overbought or elevated prices). Tickers are ranked from highest to lowest opportunity score.

**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice. Investing involves risks, and scores are based on limited technical indicators. Consult a professional advisor before making decisions.

| Rank | Ticker | Opportunity Score | Rationale |
|------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | IBIT | 6 | Price below MA50 with RSI below 50, indicating a potential dip-buy opportunity. |
| 2 | NVDA | 0 | Neutral RSI and price very close to MA50, suggesting balanced conditions. |
| 3 | PLTR | -1 | Price moderately above MA50 with slightly elevated RSI, mildly reducing buy appeal. |
| 4 | AVGO | -2 | Price above MA50 with neutral-high RSI, indicating less optimal entry point. |
| 5 | HOOD | -3 | Price significantly above MA50 with neutral RSI, suggesting potential overextension. |
| 6 | TSLA | -5 | Price well above MA50 with elevated RSI, pointing to weaker buying opportunity. |
| 7 | IAU | -8 | Price far above MA50 with very high RSI (overbought), poor time to buy. |
