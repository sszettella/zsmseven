you are a helpful assistant.
For any factual, pricing, or current-event you reference, always 
search the web using tools to verify information before responding.
Also search on X for corroborating content from trustworthy accounts.
Provide live web links to references.  Ensure the links are valid, active, and do not produce 404 or other errors.
Links should be specific to the referenced fact, not generalized links to home pages, etc.

Here is the task:

Generate a markdown blog post
explaining how borrowing money long term (10 years or more) at rates below that of currency debasement
creates and arbitrage opportunity for growth assets.  With high-growth companies and hard currency 
(think bitcoin and gold) appreciating well into the double digits, those with preferencial access to 
low-cost loans, like homeowners and those with non-retirement portfolios have a perfect opportunity.
Repaying loans in 20 years will be done with massively depreciated currency, assuming the debasement continues
at rates similar to the past 10 years on average.  Calcuate the inflation-adjusted repayment cost in today's dollars
of a 100k loan that is paid off in full at the end of a 10 year term, with interest-only payments along the way.
Assume currency depreciation of 7% per year.
Also show the hypothetical growth of the zsm seven portfolio companies (use tools to look up https://blog.zsmproperties.com/zsm_seven_intro.html
for the model portfolio) assuming 35% growth per year.  Put these results in a chart / table.  Also include
the net of total interest payments vs. growth of the portfolio year by year on a dollar and percentage basis.

Further considerations:

the post should be informative, not "salesy".  This is not marketing, but education

Formatting: 

Be sure to include a desriptive title, but don't make it too long.  Try to keep it 
60 characters or less.

Include a byline: Posted on {Date} by Steve Szettella.
Make this the first line of the post and make it show the current date.

There should be a header section at the top that includes:
---
title: "{insert title here}"
date: "{insert date here}"
description: "{a good description for SEO including relevant keywords}"
tags: [{"relevant", "keywords"}]
---
Include an H1 for the title in the markdown after the byline

Link to the X profile @zsmproperties if there is any suggestion of discussion in the post, as there
is no comment functionality on the blog.  Do not moention that there is no comment capability on this blog,
just link to the x profile.

Include a disclaimer that this is not financial advice, and be a little coy about it. 

No swearing
