# Macro Signals Favor Bitcoin and Gold Over Real Estate

As we glide into the final quarter of 2025, the macroeconomic landscape is painting a concerning picture for the US dollar. With persistent inflation hovering above the Federal Reserve's targets, ballooning national debt exceeding $37 trillion, and geopolitical tensions adding fuel to the fire, the stage is set for accelerated currency devaluation. This isn't just theory—recent Fed minutes hint at prolonged loose monetary policy to stave off recession, which historically erodes purchasing power. In this environment, traditional investments like real estate are looking increasingly shaky, while alternatives like Bitcoin and gold emerge as resilient hedges.

### The Macro Case for Dollar Weakness
Let's break down the key drivers. First, fiscal irresponsibility: The US government's deficit spending shows no signs of abating, with projections from the Congressional Budget Office warning of debt-to-GDP ratios climbing toward 120% by decade's end. This flood of new dollars into the economy dilutes its value, much like adding water to soup—it tastes weaker overall.

Second, inflation metrics are deceptive. Official CPI numbers may understate true cost-of-living increases, especially in essentials like energy and food, where supply chain disruptions from global conflicts persist. Add in the BRICS nations' push for de-dollarization—think increased trade in yuan or rubles—and the dollar's reserve status is under real threat. For investors, this means your cash and cash-equivalent assets are quietly losing ground. A depreciating dollar isn't just a headline; it's a stealth tax on savings.

### Why Real Estate Falls Short in a Devaluing World
Real estate has long been touted as an inflation hedge, but let's be real—it's a high-maintenance gamble in today's macro climate. Sure, rents might rise with inflation, but so do property taxes, insurance premiums, and repair costs, often outpacing any gains. Vacancy rates are creeping up in oversupplied markets, and liability risks from tenant disputes or natural disasters (exacerbated by climate volatility) add layers of headache.

Maintenance alone can eat 1-2% of a property's value annually, not to mention the illiquidity trap: Try selling a multifamily unit during a downturn without taking a haircut. We've seen this play out in recent cycles, where leveraged real estate portfolios crumbled under rising interest rates. If you're eyeing traditional property investments, consider the [ZSM Seven portfolio](zsm_seven_intro) as a more streamlined alternative for diversified exposure without the solo-owner burdens. But even then, in a rapidly devaluing dollar scenario, bricks and mortar may not keep pace with smarter stores of value.


### Bitcoin: The Digital Economy's Foundation
Enter Bitcoin, the decentralized antidote to fiat fragility. As the base layer for the emerging digital economy, BTC's fixed supply of 21 million coins positions it perfectly against endless dollar printing. Adoption is accelerating—major institutions like BlackRock continue to stack sats, and nation-states are eyeing it as a reserve asset. In the coming decades, expect Bitcoin to underpin everything from cross-border payments to smart contracts, rendering it indispensable.

With halvings reducing new supply every four years, Bitcoin's scarcity rivals gold's but with modern utility. Amid dollar devaluation, its price has historically surged during inflationary spikes. If you're new to this, it's not just "digital gold"—it's the backbone of Web3 finance.

### Gold's Enduring Appeal
Don't sleep on physical gold, either. Its low stock-to-flow ratio—meaning new supply is a tiny fraction of existing stockpiles—makes it a timeless store of value. Unlike real estate, gold requires zero upkeep, no tenants, and zero liability. In a world of depreciating dollars, gold has preserved wealth through centuries of currency crises, from Roman denarii to Weimar hyperinflation.

Current macro signals, like weakening dollar index (DXY) trends, suggest gold could rally toward $4,500 per ounce by year-end. It's the ultimate "set it and forget it" hedge, especially as central banks diversify away from USD reserves.

### Wrapping Up: Position for the Inevitable
The macro winds are shifting toward US dollar devaluation, and savvy investors will pivot accordingly. Ditch the real estate illusions and lean into Bitcoin's digital dominance and gold's proven resilience. Of course, I'm just sharing observations from the trenches—this isn't financial advice, but if it sparks your interest, who knows? You might thank me later.
