<h2>Debt Arbitrage in a Debasement Era</h2>
<p>In a world where currencies are steadily eroding in value—a process often called debasement—there's an intriguing economic angle to borrowing money over the long haul at rates below that erosion. This isn't about reckless gambling; it's about spotting a structural edge in how money works today. If you lock in low fixed-rate debt and channel it into assets that outrun debasement, you're essentially arbitraging the system's own flaws. Think high-growth stocks fueled by the geometric explosion of AI, or hard assets like Bitcoin and gold, which have posted impressive gains in debasement-heavy eras. Historically, these have delivered double-digit annual returns in key stretches, often leaving inflation in the dust.</p>
<p>Let's ground this in context. Currency debasement isn't abstract—it's the quiet theft of purchasing power through money supply growth and inflation. Over the last decade (2014-2024), U.S. CPI inflation averaged about 2.8% annually, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), while broader M2 money supply expanded at around 8-10% on average, driven by post-pandemic stimulus (sources: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cpi/">BLS CPI data</a> and <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL">Federal Reserve M2 stats</a>). Insights from official channels like @federalreserve on X highlight these trends, with similar patterns echoed by the ECB. If we project a ongoing debasement rate of around 7% (a reasonable midpoint blending CPI and M2, allowing for some opinion on future policy), repaying debt down the line gets cheaper in real terms as the dollar's value fades.</p>
<p>This setup tilts the scales toward those who can snag low-cost, long-term loans—say, via home equity lines or margin against diversified portfolios. The idea? Invest in assets poised for outsized growth, then settle the debt with weaker future dollars. Risks abound, from market swings to rate hikes, but the underlying math reveals a compelling asymmetry, especially in a debasement-fueled world.</p>
<h4>Inflation-Adjusted Repayment Cost Example</h4>
<p>Picture a $100,000 loan over 10 years, with interest-only payments and the principal due at the end. At a 7% annual debasement rate (our speculative but informed assumption), the real burden of that $100,000 repayment shrinks dramatically in today's dollars.</p>
<p>The present value formula:<br />
Present Value = Future Amount / (1 + Depreciation Rate)^Years  </p>
<p>Crunching it:<br />
Present Value = $100,000 / (1.07)^10 ≈ $100,000 / 1.9672 ≈ $50,833  </p>
<p>Essentially, it'd feel like forking over just $50,833 in current purchasing power after a decade. Factor in interest, and the total cost rises, but smart investments could more than cover it.</p>
<p>Stretch to 20 years: Present Value = $100,000 / (1.07)^20 ≈ $100,000 / 3.8697 ≈ $25,841. Longer terms amplify the effect, making 10+ year fixed-rate debt a potential powerhouse if rates stay below debasement levels.</p>
<h4>Hypothetical Growth of the ZSM Seven Portfolio</h4>
<p>To see the arbitrage in action, consider deploying those borrowed funds into a high-conviction portfolio like the ZSM Seven—a curated mix of seven tech titans dominating AI, cloud, and innovation (details in the post at <a href="https://blog.zsmproperties.com/zsm_seven_intro.html">ZSM Seven Intro</a>).</p>
<p>We're assuming a bold 35% annual growth rate here—speculative, sure, but rooted in the geometric scaling of AI (e.g., Nvidia's chips powering exponential compute growth, with historical Magnificent Seven returns topping 20% in bull phases, per Yahoo Finance historical data). Borrow the $100,000 at 4% interest (below our 7% debasement guess, mimicking prime borrower rates). Annual interest: $4,000, paid from other sources for this model.</p>
<p>The table tracks:
- <strong>Portfolio Value</strong>: Growing from $100,000 at 35% annually.
- <strong>Interest Paid (Nominal)</strong>: $4,000/year.
- <strong>Cumulative Interest Paid</strong>: Running total.
- <strong>Net Value</strong>: Portfolio value minus cumulative interest paid minus any remaining principal liability (principal is a liability until repaid at year 10; the year-10 repayment is treated as a final outflow).
- <strong>Net % Gain</strong>: Gain over initial $100,000, after all costs.</p>

</table>
<p>By year 10, the portfolio hits over $2 million nominally. After subtracting all costs—including $40,000 in interest and the $100,000 principal repayment—the net value is about $1.87 million. Adjust for inflation, and the real gain looks even stronger, as debasement erodes the repayment's bite. This scenario favors the debasement thesis, suggesting hard assets like Bitcoin or gold could serve as reliable hedges, potentially outlasting fiat volatility.</p>
<p>After year 10, repaying the $100,000 principal leaves ~$1,870,658 (pre-taxes/fees; real principal cost ~$50,833 inflation-adjusted).  </p>
