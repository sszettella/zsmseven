# Trump's Tariff Tantrum: Punching the Market (and Why We Just Bought the Dip)

Ah, Fridays. That magical day when the workweek exhales, cocktails flow, and... apparently, former presidents decide to swing haymakers at global trade. October 10, 2025, will go down as the day Donald Trump dusted off his tariff playbook and clocked the market square in the nose. Whispers of 60% levies on Chinese imports? Check. Renewed bluster on EU duties? Double check. The Dow plunged 1.8%, Nasdaq shed 2.3%, and even our old pal the S&P 500 looked like it had one too many at happy hour, down 1.5%.

It was a bloodbath, folks—a classic overreaction to political theater in an election cycle that's already got more plot twists than a telenovela. But here's the snarky truth: Markets love a good villain monologue, especially when it's recycled from 2018. And while the suits on CNBC clutched pearls and the algos hit the panic button, we at ZSM saw something else entirely. Opportunity. A flash sale on fear, courtesy of the man who treats economics like a WWE smackdown.

## ZSM's Play: Dry Powder Meets Discounted Digital Gold

Earlier this week, we'd trimmed a sliver of underperforming legacy tech—nothing dramatic, just freeing up some dry powder to keep the portfolio nimble. Perfect timing. As the tariff tweets lit up the tape and BTC dipped below $118K (from its intra-week perch), we pounced. Stacked more Bitcoin, baby. Why? Because in the grand casino of fiat debasement, BTC isn't just a chip—it's the house edge.

Our ZSM Seven portfolio, that debasement-defying beast we unveiled yesterday, is already 24.4% allocated to Bitcoin for exactly these moments. It's the zero-trust anchor in a world where central banks print money like it's going out of style (spoiler: fiat is). Gold (IAU at 14.6%) held steady as a rock—up 0.8% amid the melee—but BTC? It got dragged down 3.2% on the day, purely by association with risk-on assets. Collateral damage from tariff FUD, not fundamentals.

We didn't go all-in (patience is a virtue, even for high-rollers), but that opportunistic buy juiced our BTC weighting to a comfy 28% temporarily. It's like spotting a Rolex at 20% off during a fire sale—you don't ask why the store's on fire; you just grab the deal.

## The Rebound Thesis: Blood in the Water, But Sharks Swim Up

Look, Friday's carnage? It's the market's version of a toddler's tantrum—loud, messy, and forgotten by nap time. Next week? We expect a V-shaped recovery, clawing back 80-100% of these losses. Why the optimism, you ask, with a side-eye at my crystal ball?

- **Tariff Talk is Cheap**: Trump's bark has outpaced his bite since day one. Remember the 2016-2020 cycle? Threats galore, but actual implementations were surgical, not scorched-earth. Markets front-run the noise, then exhale when reality (read: negotiations) sets in. By Monday, expect cooler heads and bargain-hunting.

- **BTC's Bouncy Castle Resilience**: Crypto doesn't care about your trade wars; it thrives on monetary mayhem. With ETF inflows hitting $2.5B last week alone and halving scars fully healed, this dip is catnip for institutions. Adjacent plays like HOOD (our fintech wildcard) tanked 4.1% Friday but could snap back 10%+ on volume. Hell, even PLTR and NVDA—our AI darlings—barely blinked, down under 1%, proving the ZSM Seven's tech core is tariff-proof.

- **Debasement Dial Turned to 11**: Inflation data out next week? Whispered at 3.2% core PCE. Fed's still dovish, yields compressing, and geopolitics ensuring the dollar's "reserve" status feels more like a suggestion. BTC and gold aren't hedges; they're accelerators in this environment. Expect BTC to kiss $125K by mid-week, leaving the VIX-chasers in the dust.

In short: Equities might limp home green, but BTC and its orbit? They'll moonwalk right past Friday's ghosts. The ZSM Seven's macro buffer (BTC + IAU at nearly 40%) turned what could've been a -2% portfolio day into a flatline yawn. Resilient? Understatement. It's like having a force field in a knife fight.

## Tying It Back: ZSM Seven's Edge in the Chaos

[Yesterday's intro to the ZSM Seven](./zsm_seven_intro) wasn't just hype—it was a roadmap for exactly this. While the MAG7 chugs along on cloud dreams, we're laser-focused on AI's underbelly (NVDA, AVGO, PLTR), mobility's moonshot (TSLA), and the ultimate fiat hedge (BTC, IAU, HOOD). That 158.7% one-year rip we clocked? It's not luck; it's architecture for asymmetry.

Tariff tantrums like today's are just speed bumps on the road to 2030s dominance. Paradigm shifts don't pause for politics—they accelerate.

## Outlook: Stack Wins, Not Worries

We see 3-6% upside for the ZSM Seven next week alone, versus flat-to-up 2% for the broader indices. Catalysts? Fading FUD, AI capex announcements, and that sweet, sweet debasement drip. For the aspiring (or already minted) high-net-worth crowd: Keep some powder dry. Volatility is the tollbooth on the wealth superhighway—pay it, then floor it.

The future's programmable, alright. And right now, it's coding in green.
