### Portfolio Opportunity Scores Overview

This analysis evaluates the "ZSM Seven" portfolio tickers based on their current price relative to the 50-day moving average (MA50) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). The opportunity score ranges from -10 to 10, where 10 indicates an excellent buying opportunity (e.g., oversold conditions and price below MA50), and -10 suggests a poor time to buy (e.g., overbought and significantly above MA50). Scores are derived from a combination of these indicators: lower RSI (below 50, especially under 30) and price below MA50 contribute positively, while high RSI (above 70) and price well above MA50 contribute negatively.

Tickers are ranked from highest to lowest opportunity score.
