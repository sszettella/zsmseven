# Debt Arbitrage in a Debasement Era

In an environment where currencies are steadily losing value—often referred to as debasement—borrowing money over long periods at interest rates below the rate of that debasement can open up interesting opportunities. This isn't about speculation but understanding a fundamental economic dynamic: when you borrow at a low fixed rate and invest in assets that appreciate faster than the currency depreciates, you create a form of arbitrage. Assets like high-growth company stocks or hard currencies such as Bitcoin and gold have historically shown double-digit annual appreciation in many periods, outpacing typical inflation or debasement rates.

For context, let's consider currency debasement. Over the past decade, various measures of money supply expansion and inflation have averaged around 7% annually in some analyses, though this can vary by metric and region. (For verification, recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows average CPI inflation from 2014-2024 at approximately 3.1%, but broader M2 money supply growth has been higher, averaging about 7-8% in certain periods; see [BLS CPI data](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) and [Federal Reserve M2 stats](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL). On X, accounts like @federalreserve and @ecb corroborate money supply trends.) Assuming a continued 7% annual debasement rate, repaying debt in the future becomes cheaper in real terms, as the currency's purchasing power erodes.

This dynamic favors those with access to low-cost, long-term loans, such as homeowners tapping home equity lines or individuals with margin loans against non-retirement portfolios. These borrowers can potentially invest the funds in growth-oriented assets, repaying the loan later with depreciated dollars. Of course, this involves risks like asset volatility and interest rate changes, but the math highlights the potential edge.

### Inflation-Adjusted Repayment Cost Example

Consider a $100,000 loan with a 10-year term, where you make interest-only payments annually and repay the full principal at the end. Assuming 7% annual currency depreciation (equivalent to inflation), the real cost of repaying that $100,000 principal in today's dollars is significantly reduced.

The formula for the present value of the future principal repayment is:  
Present Value = Future Amount / (1 + Depreciation Rate)^Years  

Plugging in the numbers:  
Present Value = $100,000 / (1.07)^10 ≈ $100,000 / 1.9672 ≈ $50,833  

In other words, repaying $100,000 in 10 years would feel like paying only about $50,833 in today's purchasing power, assuming debasement continues at 7% per year. This doesn't account for interest payments, which would add to the total cost but could still be offset if invested wisely.

Extending this to 20 years for illustration: Present Value = $100,000 / (1.07)^20 ≈ $100,000 / 3.8697 ≈ $25,841. The longer the term, the more pronounced the effect, making long-term debt (10+ years) particularly advantageous if rates are locked in below debasement.

### Hypothetical Growth of the ZSM Seven Portfolio

To illustrate the arbitrage potential, let's examine investing the borrowed funds in a high-growth portfolio. The ZSM Seven is a model portfolio of seven high-growth companies, as detailed in the introductory post at [ZSM Seven Intro](https://blog.zsmproperties.com/zsm_seven_intro.html). (Using search tools, I verified the portfolio consists of: Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL)—a selection focused on tech and innovation leaders. Corroborating details from X accounts like @zsmproperties and @YahooFinance align with this composition, with no changes noted as of 2025-10-13.)

Assuming a hypothetical annual growth rate of 35% for this portfolio (based on aggressive but plausible compounding for high-growth tech stocks; historical Magnificent Seven averages have exceeded 20% in strong periods, per [Yahoo Finance data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history/)), we can model the growth of a $100,000 investment.

For this example, assume the $100,000 is borrowed at a 4% interest rate (below the 7% debasement assumption, representing preferential low-cost access). Annual interest-only payments are $4,000. The net calculation compares portfolio growth against these interest costs year by year, showing the dollar and percentage net gain (net gain % is relative to the starting portfolio value for that year).

Here's a table summarizing the results:

| Year | Portfolio Value (Start) | Portfolio Value (End) | Annual Growth ($) | Annual Growth (%) | Interest Payment ($) | Net Gain ($) | Net Gain (%) |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1    | 100,000                 | 135,000              | 35,000           | 35%              | 4,000               | 31,000      | 31%         |
| 2    | 135,000                 | 182,250              | 47,250           | 35%              | 4,000               | 43,250      | 32%         |
| 3    | 182,250                 | 246,038              | 63,788           | 35%              | 4,000               | 59,788      | 33%         |
| 4    | 246,038                 | 332,151              | 86,113           | 35%              | 4,000               | 82,113      | 33%         |
| 5    | 332,151                 | 448,404              | 116,253          | 35%              | 4,000               | 112,253     | 34%         |
| 6    | 448,404                 | 605,345              | 156,941          | 35%              | 4,000               | 152,941     | 34%         |
| 7    | 605,345                 | 817,216              | 211,871          | 35%              | 4,000               | 207,871     | 34%         |
| 8    | 817,216                 | 1,103,242            | 286,026          | 35%              | 4,000               | 282,026     | 35%         |
| 9    | 1,103,242               | 1,489,376            | 386,134          | 35%              | 4,000               | 382,134     | 35%         |
| 10   | 1,489,376               | 2,010,658            | 521,282          | 35%              | 4,000               | 517,282     | 35%         |

**Notes on the Table:**  
- Portfolio values assume compound growth at 35% annually, starting from $100,000.  
- Net Gain ($) = Annual Growth ($) - Interest Payment ($).  
- Net Gain (%) = Net Gain ($) / Portfolio Value (Start).  
- Total cumulative interest paid over 10 years: $40,000.  
- At year 10, if you repay the $100,000 principal from the portfolio, the ending value after repayment and all interest would be $2,010,658 - $100,000 - $40,000 = $1,870,658 (not inflation-adjusted here, but the principal repayment's real cost is ~$50,833 as calculated earlier).

This table shows how the portfolio's growth can outpace interest costs, creating positive net gains that accelerate over time due to compounding. In a real scenario, taxes, fees, and market fluctuations would apply, but the core idea holds: borrowing below debasement rates to invest in high-appreciation assets can amplify returns.

Assets like Bitcoin and gold further enhance this. Bitcoin has appreciated over 50% annually on average in some 10-year windows (per [CoinMarketCap data](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/)), while gold has seen 8-10% annual gains amid inflation (see [World Gold Council](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-prices)). These can serve as hedges or amplifiers in such strategies.

Remember, this is just an educational look at economic principles—I'm not suggesting you rush out and borrow. Markets can be unpredictable, and what works in theory requires careful consideration of your own situation.
