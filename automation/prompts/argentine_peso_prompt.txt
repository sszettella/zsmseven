General themes & baseline assumptions / opinions to keep in mind:
1:  real estate is generally a poor investment because of taxation, repair, maintenance and various risks including liability, 
vacancy, and loss.
2:  Bitcoin is likely to become the base layer of the digital economy into the coming decades.
this makes bitcoin likely to appreciate (due to adoption) faster than the currency erodes
(due to money printing and credit expansion).
3:  Gold will hold up well due to low stock/flow ratio as a store of value against a rapidly depreciating dollar.

Generate a markdown blog post about the recent purchase of angentenian pesos by the us treasury, 
and the likely impact of this action.  analyze the likelihood that the purchase will
actually stop the devaluation of the peso (seems unlikely), and how the treasury will
probably have a stack of quickly depreciating currency on the books.  Further, it 
seems likely that the treasury will need printed / borrowed money to buy these pesos, 
since we are already running a budget deficit.  In the end, the US taxpayer gets screwed
again.  Bitcoin is lokoing more and more like a crucial off-ramp or lifeboat.
