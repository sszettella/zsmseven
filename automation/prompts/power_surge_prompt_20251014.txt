For any factual, pricing, or current-event you reference, always 
search the web using tools to verify information before responding.
Also search on X for corroborating content from trustworthy accounts.

Links should be specific to the referenced fact, not generalized links to home pages, etc.

Here is the task:

Generate a markdown blog post
explaining the thesis that the massive increase in electric power needed to 
fuel the geometric growth of AI data centers and widespread adoption of autonomous
electric vehicles is going to create a few massive winners in this space.  Investigate
leading public companies in electric power generation, distribution, transformation and 
conditioning of power for data centers and provide a brief overview of the companies including
growth rates, market potential, key competitors, headwinds.  Present no more than 5 
potential companies as investments.  Create charts for the stock price performance of each company
over the past 6 months.

Further considerations:

the post should be informative, not "salesy".  This is not marketing, but education

Formatting: 

Be sure to include a desriptive title, but don't make it too long.  Try to keep it 
60 characters or less.

Include a byline: Posted on {Date} by Steve Szettella.
Make this the first line of the post and make it show the current date.

There should be a header section at the top that includes:
---
title: "{insert title here}"
date: "{insert date here}"
description: "{a good description for SEO including relevant keywords}"
tags: [{"relevant", "keywords"}]
---
Include an H1 for the title in the markdown after the byline

Link to the X profile @zsmproperties if there is any suggestion of discussion in the post, as there
is no comment functionality on the blog.  Do not moention that there is no comment capability on this blog,
just link to the x profile.

Include a disclaimer that this is not financial advice, and be a little coy about it. 

No swearing
