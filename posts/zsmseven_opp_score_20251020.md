### Portfolio Opportunity Scores

This analysis evaluates each ticker in the "ZSM Seven" portfolio based on key technical indicators: current price compared to the 50-day moving average (MA50) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The opportunity score ranges from -10 to 10, where a higher score indicates a stronger buying opportunity (e.g., oversold conditions or price below MA50 suggesting undervaluation). Scores are derived as follows:

- **Positive scores**: Indicate potential buying opportunities, with 10 being ideal (e.g., low RSI <30 and price significantly below MA50).
- **Neutral scores**: Around 0 for balanced metrics.
- **Negative scores**: Suggest caution or overbought conditions (e.g., high RSI >70 and price above MA50).

Ranked from highest to lowest opportunity score:

| Ticker | Price | MA50 | RSI | Opportunity Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|------|-----|-------------------|-----------|
| IBIT  | 60.47 | 65.22 | 35.63 | 8 | Price below MA50 with RSI near oversold, indicating a strong buying opportunity. |
| HOOD  | 129.91 | 121.47 | 47.74 | 5 | Price above MA50 but neutral RSI suggests moderate upside potential. |
| PLTR  | 178.15 | 172.13 | 51.78 | 4 | Slightly above MA50 with neutral RSI; fair opportunity but not exceptional. |
| NVDA  | 183.22 | 179.57 | 51.42 | 4 | Above MA50, neutral RSI; similar to peers but steady momentum. |
| AVGO  | 349.33 | 327.88 | 55.52 | 3 | Above MA50 with mid-range RSI; potential for growth but not undervalued. |
| TSLA  | 439.31 | 387.45 | 56.74 | 3 | Significantly above MA50, neutral-to-high RSI; momentum-driven but risky. |
| IAU   | 79.63 | 69.23 | 75.39 | -5 | Price well above MA50 with overbought RSI, suggesting possible pullback. |
