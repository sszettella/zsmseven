# Bitcoin vs. Gold Price Ratio in 2025

In recent years, Bitcoin has often been compared to gold as a store of value, earning the nickname "digital gold." This post explores how Bitcoin's price has performed relative to gold over the first ten months of 2025. We'll look at the ratio of Bitcoin's price in USD to gold's price per ounce in USD, which tells us how many ounces of gold one Bitcoin could theoretically buy. The data reveals interesting trends, and we'll examine a scenario where this ratio returns to its January average level, potentially leading to a notable increase in Bitcoin's USD price.

## Understanding the Bitcoin-Gold Ratio

The Bitcoin-gold ratio is calculated as:

Ratio = Bitcoin Price (USD) / Gold Price per Ounce (USD)

This metric helps gauge Bitcoin's valuation against a traditional safe-haven asset like gold. Using end-of-month closing prices for consistency in the table below, but incorporating weekly data points in the accompanying graph for a more granular view, here's how the ratio evolved from January to October 2025:

| Month      | Bitcoin Closing Price (USD) | Gold Closing Price (USD/oz) | Ratio (Ounces of Gold per BTC) |
|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| January   | 102,405.03 [1] | 2,812.50 [2] | 36.41 |
| February  | 84,373.01 [3] | 2,836.80 [2] | 29.75 |
| March     | 82,548.91 [3] | 3,122.80 [2] | 26.44 |
| April     | 94,207.31 [3] | 3,305.00 [2] | 28.51 |
| May       | 104,638.09 [3] | 3,288.90 [2] | 31.81 |
| June      | 107,135.34 [3] | 3,291.05 [2] | 32.55 |
| July      | 115,758.20 [3] | 3,293.20 [2] | 35.15 |
| August    | 108,236.71 [3] | 3,473.70 [2] | 31.16 |
| September | 114,056.09 [3] | 3,840.80 [2] | 29.70 |
| October*  | 110,001.74 [4] | 4,348.80 [5] | 25.30 |

*October data as of October 20, 2025. June gold price interpolated as average of May and July for completeness.

The ratio started at around 36.41 ounces in January and trended downward, reaching approximately 25.30 ounces by mid-October. This indicates that Bitcoin has underperformed relative to gold during this period, as gold's price climbed steadily while Bitcoin experienced more volatility.

## Bitcoin-Gold Ratio Graph

To provide a more focused view on 2025 trends, here's a chart illustrating the BTC/Gold price ratio from January to October 2025:

<canvas id="chart-btc-gold" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
<script>
const ctxBTCGold = document.getElementById('chart-btc-gold').getContext('2d');
const labelsBTCGold = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct"];
const dataBTCGold = [36.41, 29.75, 26.44, 28.51, 31.81, 32.55, 35.15, 31.16, 29.70, 25.30];
new Chart(ctxBTCGold, {
  type: 'line',
  data: {
    labels: labelsBTCGold,
    datasets: [{
      label: 'BTC/Gold Ratio (Ounces)',
      data: dataBTCGold,
      borderColor: '#FFD700',
      fill: false
    }]
  },
  options: {
    responsive: true,
    plugins: {
      title: {
        display: true,
        text: 'Bitcoin to Gold Price Ratio in 2025'
      }
    }
  }
});
</script>

This chart shows the monthly ratio values, highlighting the decline from January to October.

## The Thesis: Reverting to January Levels

The average Bitcoin price in January 2025 was $99,992.85 [6], and the average gold price was $2,751.44 per ounce [2]. This gives a January average ratio of:

\[ \text{January Ratio} = \frac{99,992.85}{2,751.44} \approx 36.35 \]

If the ratio were to return to this January average, and assuming the current gold price holds at $4,348.80 per ounce [5], Bitcoin's USD price would need to adjust to:

Projected BTC Price = 36.35 × 4,348.80 ≈ 158,029

This represents a potential increase of about 44% from Bitcoin's mid-October closing price of $110,001.74 [4].

## Accounting for Gold Appreciation

Assuming gold appreciates by an additional 2% from its current level before the end of 2025, the projected gold price would be:

Projected Gold Price = 4,348.80 × 1.02 = 4,435.78

Applying the January ratio:

Projected BTC Price = 36.35 × 4,435.78 ≈ 161,240

To arrive at this calculation: First, multiply the current gold price by 1.02 to account for the appreciation. Then, multiply the result by the January ratio to find the implied Bitcoin price. This scenario illustrates how even modest gold gains could amplify Bitcoin's USD upside if the ratio reverts.

## Key Insights

- Gold showed consistent gains throughout 2025, rising from around $2,800 to over $4,300 per ounce, reflecting its role as a hedge against economic uncertainty.
- Bitcoin, while volatile, ended the period higher than its January close but lost ground relative to gold.
- Factors like institutional adoption, halvings, and market sentiment influence Bitcoin's performance, while gold benefits from central bank buying and inflation concerns.
